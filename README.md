To-do list allows users to add tasks and saves these tasks in local storage so users will be able to access those tasks even if the browser is closed. 

There is a "done" button for the user to press when the task is completed. This allows users to track their progress.

There are 6 themes in the website (including the default theme) which are white(default),blue, green, orange, grey and purple for the user to choose from and make their experience more appealing.

Simply enter the task in the "type text here" input box and click the submit or "+" button. There is a character limit of 130 characters for each input. The task will then be displayed on the screen and users may click the delete button to remove the task from the screen.

To-do list is responsive and will adjust to screens of all sizes.
